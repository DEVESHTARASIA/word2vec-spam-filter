### web client
To use the web client go into the `webclient` directory in your terminal and then:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

That should install all dependencies and kick start the project, if it all works you should see something like:
 > Project is running at http://localhost:3333/  
 > webpack output is served from /

Now load http://localhost:3333/ in your browser
